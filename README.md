# SerialRobotManipulator

This is a simulation of a serial robotic manipulator.
Firstly the manipulator has been designed in SolidWork and then exported as .xml document.
The .xml document is imported in simulink, in matlab, where the controller has been designed and a program for the manipulator has been written.
The simulation of the serial robotic manipulator has been perform under 3 different control mechanism and the result are presented.
